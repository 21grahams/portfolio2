        Hi! I'm Graham. I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Boulder,
        Colorado. Having built many applications, both individually and as part
        of teams, I thoroughly enjoy seeing the front page of a website
        transform into something elegant and beautiful. I also enjoy
        optimization, scaling and working with data. Some of my projects include
        the building of a page for an e-commerce website, a comprehensive API
        that satisfies all needed requests, an app dedicated to providing
        up-to-date and quality photographs directly from NASA's API and a
        company events application to create, join and organize internal events
        for employees. I would like to use my engineering skills to build
        meaningful solutions to help sustain a healthier and better future for
        planet Earth and humanity.

        Upon graduation at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado in which I
        received Magna Cum Laude Honors, I relocated to Denver, Colorado where I
        began my professional career. I became the youngest promoter in history
        to promote two large-scale charity events at the legendary Red Rocks
        Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado in 2013 and 2014. I then transitioned
        into Real Estate and helped my team at TRELORA sell over 100 homes both
        on the buying and listing sides. Eventually, I found my way back to the
        music industry while pursuing my passion of music touring and artist
        management before finding my new love and obsession in software
        engineering.

        My interests include constant reading/learning/problem solving, working
        out/nutrition, basketball, snowboarding, networking with friends and
        colleagues and all forms of comedy.
